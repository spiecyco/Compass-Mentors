    'You must treat mentors, other students, and yourself with respect.',
    'Be welcoming of students and mentors from all backgrounds, beliefs, identities, and locations.',
    'Classes will be conducted over video conferencing software which enables students to have an interactive experience with their mentor. We expect students to actively participate in presentations and on their projects.',
    'We ask that students dress and present themselves in an appropriate manner, as well as provide an appropriate background (no physical posters that consist of violent or graphic content or inappropriate virtual backgrounds). This will assist in creating a comfortable environment for all participants.',
    'Students who participate and therefore agree to this code of conduct acknowledge that we have a zero-tolerance policy. If these guidelines are not followed, student’s parents or guardians will be notified and repeat offense would be grounds for the program removal.',
    'Students must ensure that their parents are aware of their participation and that they have reviewed the details of our program and the Codes of Conduct.'

  mentor: [
    'Conduct yourself professionally, prepare for your class, and treat fellow mentors, students, parents/guardians, and other participants with respect. Aim to be a role model for your students.',
    'Mentors can not perform, nor condone anyone else to perform, any activities that may cause harm to anyone or anything.',
    'Your classes cannot include you or your students doing illegal activities, nor can you explicitly promote illegal activities (e.g. “How to make drugs 101”).',
    'We allow our mentors to cover religious, controversial, and politically charged topics as long as they do so in a manner that does not make students feel targeted, unduly uncomfortable, or unable to disagree. While the material may be the same, there is a difference between “preaching” and “teaching” and we require that mentors cover such controversial topics in an open-minded and informative manner.',
    'Mentors cannot use classes as an opportunity to sell products to students or pressure students to join outside organizations.',
    'We do not allow classes to be used as a platform for gathering data. Surveys are permitted as long as that information is not taken or used outside of the classroom.',
    'Mentors should never share their personal contact information (other than phone number and email), nor request that of their students. Mentors should exercise extreme caution when directly messaging a student, and do so only if necessary.'

  parent: [
    'Parents or Guardians should understand that Compass Mentors is an event for students to help other students. It is not designed to include parents or guardians (while parents can sit in) beyond granting or withholding permission and project funding (if necessary) for their children to participate.',
    'Parents or Guardians must and will be made aware of their students’ involvement and progress through emails. They are responsible for reviewing the Codes of Conduct for all participants.',
    // 'If Parents or Guardians are not getting emails of the student progress, they should notify us immediately at compassmentors2020@gmail.com.'
